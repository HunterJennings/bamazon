bamazon is a app that uses a database too show quantity and stock of an item and then allows you to pull from the database as if you were buying things off of amazon or any store! 

To run bamazon open up your terminal and type in " node bamazonCustomer.js" and it will direct you through the app and show you how to use it!

I have images in the images folder showing you what the app does.
